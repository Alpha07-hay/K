            <div class="paragp">This birthday feels different, quieter, and heavier—but it also carries more meaning than ever. You’re here, you’re fighting, and that alone makes today special. After everything you’ve been through, your strength stands louder than any celebration ever could.
                                  </div>

            <div class="paragp">You’ve faced something terrifying and come out still breathing, still standing, still here with us—and that is nothing short of a miracle. I hope this year gives you healing where your body hurts, peace where your mind feels tired, and patience for the days recovery feels slow. Take your time, brother. There is no rush when it comes to getting better.</div>

            <div class="paragp">Know this: you are deeply loved, needed, and prayed for. Your family is proud of you—not just for surviving, but for holding on. This birthday marks not just another year of life, but a second chance, a new chapter written with courage.</div>

            <div class="paragp">Rest, heal, and come back stronger. We’re waiting for you.</div>

            <div class="paragp">
